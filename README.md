Tools to analyse and visualise ordinal data using Permutation Entropy

## Introduction
Permutation entropy (PE) is a statistic applicable to ordered (indexed) data sets [1]. PE is similar to the Shannon entropy [2], except symbols are encoded based on the *relative ordering* of data values, rather than the data values themselves. Symbols are therefore interpreted as representations of *dynamical states* - or more colloquially, patterns made by neighbouring points. The PE therefore is a measure of how evenly represented these dynamical states are in a data set, or the level of predictability in the dynamical state of the probabilistic machine/system that produced the data.

Permutation entropy is a popular statistical measure for complex-structured data, as it 
. maps a continuum from fully stochastic (e.g. Gaussian white noise) to fully predictable outputs with high-fidelty. 
. It is relatively straight 

#### Simple Example
To highlight the basic idea of this process, it is instructive to look
